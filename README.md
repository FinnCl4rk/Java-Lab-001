## Chapter 1 Questions
1. In computer jargon, the difference between a comment and a statement is that a comment will most likely be about the 
code or algorithm or program but will have no effect on it when the code is run. A statement, on the other hand, influences
the program when the code is run, this being like a line of code in a program.
2. What it means when a program is portable is that the program will be able to run on more than one kind of computer or 
OSs like Windows, Linux, and iOS.
3. In common English, the word compile means that a high-level language like Java can be translated into a low-level language
all at once in order to be executed.
4. An executable is object code that is ready to run on specific hardware. It's used as a noun because it's referring to
the object code itself, not the action of executing said code.
